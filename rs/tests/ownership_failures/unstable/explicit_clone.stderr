error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `numbers`
  --> tests/ownership_failures/unstable/explicit_clone.rs:11:22
   |
3  |     let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   |         ------- move occurs because `numbers` has type `Vec<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
7  |     let other_numbers = numbers;
   |                         ------- value moved here
...
11 |     println!("{:?}", numbers); //~ error: borrow of moved value
   |                      ^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
   |
7  |     let other_numbers = numbers.clone();
