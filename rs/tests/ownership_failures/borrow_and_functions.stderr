error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*numbers` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference

   |                     --------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&mut Vec<i32>`

14 |     numbers.push(42);  //~ error: cannot borrow `*numbers` as mutable
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `numbers` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
